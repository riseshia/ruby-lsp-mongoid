# Sample Mongoid Models

This directory contains sample Mongoid models for testing the ruby-lsp-mongoid indexing enhancement.

## Files

- `user.rb` - Basic Mongoid model with various field types
- `post.rb` - More complex model with embedded documents and relations

## Testing the Enhancement

These models can be used to verify that the ruby-lsp-mongoid addon correctly indexes:

1. **Field accessors** - Generated reader and writer methods from `field` declarations
2. **Embedded documents** - Methods generated by `embeds_one` and `embeds_many`
3. **Relations** - Methods generated by `belongs_to`, `has_many`, `has_one`, `has_and_belongs_to_many`

## Example

When the addon is working correctly, `field :name, type: String` should generate index entries for:
- `name` (reader method)
- `name=` (writer method)

This allows Ruby LSP to provide:
- Go to definition
- Hover information
- Autocomplete suggestions
