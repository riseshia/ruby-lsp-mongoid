# Ruby LSP Mongoid

A [Ruby LSP](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp) add-on that provides enhanced editor features for [Mongoid](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongoid/current/) applications.

Similar to [ruby-lsp-rails](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp-rails), this add-on enhances Ruby LSP with Mongoid-specific functionality by providing index enhancements for methods generated by Mongoid DSLs.

> **Note:** This project is under active development. See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for planned features.

## Installation

Add this gem to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :development do
  gem "ruby-lsp-mongoid"
end
```

Then run:

```bash
bundle install
```

Ruby LSP will automatically detect and load the add-on.

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.3+
- [Ruby LSP](https://github.com/Shopify/ruby-lsp)
- [Mongoid](https://github.com/mongodb/mongoid)

## How It Works

Ruby LSP Mongoid implements the [Ruby LSP add-on interface](https://shopify.github.io/ruby-lsp/add-ons.html) to provide index enhancements. It statically analyzes Mongoid model files to understand which DSL methods are used and registers the generated methods with Ruby LSP's index.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
